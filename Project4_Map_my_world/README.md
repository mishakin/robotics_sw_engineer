## Checklist

* [ ] Basic Requirements
    - [ ] Student submited all required files: ROS Package: robot and RTABMAP Db file generated (could be link to file if oversized)

* [ ] Simulation Setup
    - [ ] Student's simulation world and robot could properly load in Gazebo.
    - [ ] The student's environment should have clear features and geometric shapes to perform mapping.

* [ ] Mapping Package
    - [ ] Student created the following launch files properly: `mapping.launch` `teleop.launch` `localization.launch`. The student's program should be able to launch without errors 

* [ ] Mapping Accuracy
    - [ ] Student's map should contain at least 3 loop closures and the occupancy grid is identifiable
    - [ ] Student's map should clearly portray the environment. The student should be able to display the characteristics of the landmark features.
